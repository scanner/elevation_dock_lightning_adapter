elevation_dock_lightning_adapter
================================

Plastic insert for the ElevationLabs Elevation Dock to use an Apple Lightning cable instead of the 30 pin dock adapter it comes with.

This is orginally based on the thing http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31429 but the calibration between whatever was made to print that and my replicator is off. The lighting cable would not even fit in to the rectangular hole they used.

So I took their idea and made my own version. Since the tolerances are pretty tight on this and every printer is slightly different at those tolerances you may need to tweak the OpenSCAD file to produce a STL that is useable. But hey, that is why this is all up on thingiverse.

I used the lightning adapter cutout from another one of my designs for this. This means that it is pretty much flush with the top of the plug, and it has a bottom so that you can not (easily at least) push it out by docking your iPhone.

Also the friction fit of the bottom plate was not as good as I wanted and repeated dockings would slowly push it out so I decided to use the two holes provided so you could screw this into the elevation dock and not have it go anywhere.

I use two M3 8mm bolts.
